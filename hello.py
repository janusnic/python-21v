# Programming involves listing all the things that must happen to solve a problem
# When writing a program first determine step-by-step what needs to happen
# Then convert those steps into the language being Python in this situation

# Every language has the following
# 1. The ability to accept input and store it in many ways
# 2. The ability to output information to the screen, files, etc.
# 3. The ability to conditionally do one thing or another thing
# 4. The ability to do something multiple times
# 5. The ability to make mathematical calculations
# 6. The ability to change data
# 7. (Object Oriented Programming) Model real world objects using code

# ---------- Hello World ----------

# Ask the user to input their name and assign it to the name variable
# Variable names start with a letter or _ and then can contain numbers
# Names are case sensitive so name is not the same as Name
name = input('What is your name ')

# Print out Hello followed by the name they entered
print('Hello ', name)


# You can't use the following for variable names
# and, del, from, not, while, as, elif, global,
# or, with, assert, else, if, pass, yield, break,
# except, import, print, class, exec, in, raise,
# continue, finally, is, return, def, for, lambda,
# try

# Single line comments are ignored by the interpreter

So are multiline comments
